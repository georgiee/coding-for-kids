^ Welcome to my talk

^ About CODING KIDS and SCREAMING CARROTS

^ And just to make sure. In this presentation I talk about kids in the age from 6 to 12 years.

^ I hope you enjoy it.

^ My name is Georgios Kaleadis

^ I'm 34 years old

^ and I live in Munich workign for Sinnerschrader as a Principal Frontend Developer

^ In my spare time I teach coding to kids

^ which inspired me so much that it brought me to this stage today.

^ I'm also Origami addicted...

^ Let's start.

^ First some nostalgia fun with me as the coding kid.

# [fit] *Nostalgia Fun*

# [fit] *The coding kid*

---
^ To make sure you have some inner picture. That's me. I'm ten years old.

# [fit] That's me

---
^ It's 1994. I call this chapter of my life Magazine Hoarder

^ For a reason.

# [fit] **_1994_**
## [fit] Magazine Hoarder

---
^ At that time I love to play with my Super Nintendo and Sega Game Gear.

---
^ My favourite place to be, month by month, is the store with the huge shelf of magazines.

![right fill](images/01-intro/magazin/01-nintendo.jpg)

---
^ Most magazines had some CD attached.

^ The ones about computers contained applications, demos, drivers & patches.

^ Why? Because internet was not available to everyone.

^ Could I use those CDs ?

![left fill](images/01-intro/pcwelt-cd.jpg)

# [fit] Drivers
# &
# [fit] Patches
---
^ Not at all.

^ I didn't even owned a computer yet.

![fit](images/01-intro/paperboard-computer.jpg)

---
^ I only got in touch with real computers

^ when my sister took me to her agency office.

^ There I had the opportunity to tinker around with a Mac running the wonderful OS 9.

![fill](images/01-intro/mac-os9.png)

---
^ Photoshop was my favourite application.

^ I created dozens of those galaxy spirals.

![fill](images/01-intro/universe.jpg)

---
^ Let's jump to 1997, the year of my first PC.

# [fit] **_1997_**
# [fit] My first PC
---
^ Actually I had to wait until Christmas 1997.

^ It's now three years since I bought my first magazine.

![fit](images/01-intro/xmas-monitor-tree.jpg)

---
^ My computer was running Windows 95 and had a 4GB hard disk.

^ This thing had of course no internet.

^ And what does a kid do with a computer ?

![fill](images/01-intro/computer-windows95.jpg)

---
^ Of course. Playing games.

^ It's 1998 and I enjoyed my new computer day and night.

# [fit] **_1998_**
# [fit] PC Gaming
---
^ My very first game I bought was Blade Runner from Westwood Studios.

^ It was distributed on 4 CDs and consumed half of my disk space.

![fit](images/01-intro/blade-runner.jpg)

---
^ Let's hurry to 1999. The year I got my internet access.

# [fit] **_1999_**
# [fit] Internet

---
^ I used a 56k modem to do so.

^ This was slower than your throttled dataplan on your smartphone.

^ Let's listen to the iconic sound for a quick flashback.

^ After Video: I still canâ€™t believe the internet worked back then.

![left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0)
![right fit](images/01-intro/modem.jpg)

---
^ It's around April 1999.

^ My favourite tv station about games and computers is **NBC Giga**

^ This particular day two guys were showing a new application

![fill](images/01-intro/giga/giga-george-jochen-2.jpg)


---
^ They animated a red ball bouncing around.

^ It must have looked like this.

![fill](images/01-intro/giga/red-ball.gif)

---
^ I was impressed

^ They mentioned the name of the application.

^ But I had to hurry back to afternoon school and didn't write it down.

^ After school I wanted to search for a demo version on all of my magazine cds.

# ðŸ˜²
# [fit] I was impressed

---
^ But I forgot the name.

^ The week went by quickly.
# [fit] I forgot the name
# ðŸ˜”

---
^ It is Saturday

^ This means getting up as early as possible

^ and watching series like Saber Rider, Captain Future or Duck Tales.

^ Around lunch time..

![](images/01-intro/saber-rider-small.gif)

---
^ I watched Giga TV again

^ And I could not believe it.

^ It was the repeated show from earlier of the week.

^ ---> I was frozen in front of my ..... TV

![fill](images/01-intro/giga/giga-logo.gif)

---

^ I holded my breath

^ I waited for the moment they would tell me that name I forgot.

^ and then

![fill](images/01-intro/homer-excited.gif )

---
^ There it was.

![fill](images/01-intro/homer-happy-2.gif )

---
^ It was Macromedia Flash 4. Released just weeks before.

![fit](images/01-intro/flash4-splash.png )

---
[.header: text-scale(0.5)]
^ This moment just now?

^ This was the genesis of my programming career.

# [fit] Genesis
## of my
# [fit] **_programming career_**

---
^ Flash looked like this.

^ A timeline, some layers and tools.

^ And of course the stage where you can see a red ball bouncing around

![fit](images/01-intro/flash4-stage.jpg )

---
^ I quickly found the place to code.

![fit](images/01-intro/flash4-actions.gif )

---
^ Soon I was able to program the very famous Yugop Menu

^ It's an horizontal navigation with the illusion of infinity.

^ I was so good in programming this thing...

![inline](images/01-intro/yugop-nakamura.jpg )
![inline fill](images/01-intro/yugop-menu.gif )

---
^ ...that I could sell it to agencies.

^ To earn my first money with 15 years.

![fill](images/01-intro/first-money.png )

---
^ It was an amazing time full of amazing websites

^ What you see here is THE PORTAL from derbauer.

^ Yes this was a website.

^ I was soooo impressed back then I and wanted to program the same myself.

![fill](images/01-intro/derbauer-theportal-small.gif )

---
^ By the way just to remind you.

^ The web without flash?

^ It looked like this

^ You can see here early websites of AOL, Yahoo, Google

![inline fill](images/01-intro/old-aol.png) ![inline fill](images/01-intro/old-yahoo.jpg)
![inline fill](images/01-intro/old-randompage.png) ![inline fill](images/01-intro/old-google.jpg)

---
^ So what's my point you're asking?

# [fit] So what's my **_point_** ?

---
^ Remember the genesis of my programming career in front of the TV ?

^ I wish I would have had some guidance during school

^ So that more than a single moment in front of the TV would have guided me to my career.

![](images/01-intro/infront-of-tv.jpg)

---
^ Instead

^ The most digital thing I had in primary school was this

![fit](images/01-intro/calculator.jpg)

---
^ Later the computer classes I remember were more like this.

![](images/01-intro/sleepy-class.jpg)

---
^ Computer classes today are still bad.

^ The hardware, if any, outdated

^ Most teachers are not educated

^ The curriculum is boring

![](images/01-intro/class-today.jpg)

---
^ I want to make a difference and change things
# [fit] Make a
# [fit] difference
---
^ That's why I'm teaching kids coding in my spare time

^ And I want you to know why I am doing this

^ and that you can do it too.

![](images/01-intro/me-teaching.jpg)

---
[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ So for the next 20 minutes I will talk about

^  1. Why coding matters.

^  2. How to teach it.

^  3. and where to teach it.

# [fit] _1. Why it matters_
# [fit] _2. How to teach_
# [fit] _3. Where to teach_

---
[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ So why does coding for kids matter at all?

^ Let's start with something easy.

# [fit] _1. Why it matters_
# 2. How to teach
# 3. Where to teach

---
^ We all can describe to a child how a combustion engine works more or less.

^ Right?

![](images/02-why/combustion-engine-small.jpg )
# _**combustion engine**_

---
^ We can tell how the human body works.

![](images/02-why/human-body-small.jpg )
# _**human body**_

---
^ But when you a press the play button a youtube video.

![](images/02-why/youtube-play.jpg )
# _**youtube play button**_
---
^ Yeah. What would you tell that kid :)

^ It's hard for many of us.

^ It's like something was missing in school.

^ So let's fix this for our children by...

# what would **_YOU_** tell that kid?

---
^ ...teaching - coding - to - kids-

^ The whole world is talking about it.

> _"teaching - coding - to - kids"_
-- everybody talks like this

---
^ New York's former major Bloomberg even had a new year resolution promising to take coding courses.

![fill](images/02-why/new-year-resolution.jpg )

---
^ Germany's Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel is talking

^ about coding as the new literacy for young people

^ besides reading, writing and math.

> "coding is the new literacy for young people"
-- Bundeskanzlerin Merkel, Digitalkonferenz, 2016 (liberally translated)

![fit](images/02-why/merkel.jpg )

---
^ All that shows that something is going on.

^ That the world is concerned about the future of our kids.

# [fit] Concerned

---
^ or that we fear that technology leaves us behind

^ and that our kids should fix it.

^ No matter what, the demand is the same...

# [fit] Fear of
# [fit] Technology

---
^ ...Our kids should learn coding.

^ Is this justified?

^ Iâ€™m biased in this question for obvious reasons.

^ So let's step back and take a look at the bigger picture.

# [fit] Kids
# **_should learn_**
# [fit] coding

---
^ We start by looking at a mechanic

^ and apply the whole coding discussion onto it.

^ It goes like this:

# [fit] _**The mechanic**_
![](images/02-why/mechanic-small.jpg )

---
^ It's sort of like an **obsession** with being an **auto mechanic**

<!-- This is mechanic comparison is coming from npr.org -->
# [fit] _**Obsession**_

---
^ There are **tons of cars**, there's tons of **driving** ...

# [fit] **_Tons of cars_**

---
^ but I think it's a little **silly** to go around saying
#### little
## **_silly_**

---
^ that **everyone**  should **_really_** learn to be an auto mechanic
# [fit] _**Everyone**_

---
^ just because cars are so **_essential_** to the **functioning** of our society.

# [fit] **_Essential_**

---
^ Yeah! That would be silly indeed.

^ But what do we do?

# [fit] **_Oh Yeah!_**
# [fit] that would be silly indeed

---
^ There is tons of technology

^ and we go around and tell everybody how important coding is.

![](images/02-why/medieval-priest.jpg)

---
^ So are we silly then?

^ Or..

^ Are we just talking about something else than coding?

# [fit] ArE wE **_silly_**?!

---
^ What if the **word coding** is born out of **confusion**?
# [fit] ~~coding~~

---
^ The question is: What do people actually mean with coding.

# What do people actually mean with **_coding_** ?

---
^ Let me go back some years

^ To the moment the first programming language was invented

# [fit] First
# [fit] Programming Language

---
^ In 1943 Konrad Zuse built his famous Z3

^ And together with it the very first programming language called Plankalkuel

# [fit] **_Plankalkuel_**
# [fit] _**1943** Konrad Zuse_
![](images/02-why/konrad-zuse.jpg )

---
^ The Z3 looked like that.

^ Technology escalated then pretty quickly

![](images/02-why/konrad-z3.jpg )

---
^ With your smartphone you hold a device that combines everything we learned in the past 70 years.

^ Thatâ€™s a lot and very complex

^ It makes computer science very difficult and not easy to talk about.

![left](images/02-why/smartphones.jpg )
# [fit] _70 years later_
# **_Technology is complex_**

---
^ Coding on the other side is easy to grasp.

# [fit] Coding?
## **_Sure, I know that_**

---
^ Take someone

^ Add a keyboard

^ And watch that person giving commands to a computer.

^ Thatâ€™s coding and the people understand it.

![](images/02-why/homer-programmer-2.gif )

---
^ If coding is such an easy word

^ Maybe that's why it's mixed up.

^ Letâ€™s try a theory.

# Let's try a
# [fit] _**Theory**_

---
[.header: text-scale(0.5)]
^ When people talk about coding they actually mean technology.

## When people talk about
# [fit] **_coding_**
## they actually mean
# [fit] **_technology_**

---
^ And people demand our kids not to learn coding

^ they actually say "our kids need to learn technology"

# our kids need to learn
# [fit]  ~~coding~~ **_technology_**

---
^ The whole coding discussion suddenly makes sense.

# [fit] The Discussion
# **_suddenly makes sense_**

---
<!-- -- via kidscodecs.com -->

^ It's not about coding anymore

^ It's about exposure to technology, computer science and programming

^ so kids can understand the bigger picture, the connecting lines.

^ Most of the kids will never be a coder anyway.

> **_Exposure to technology_**, computer science and programming.

---
^ Our children should learn that smartphones and technology are not magical.

^ That there are limitations, benefits and possibilities from using them.

## [fit] _**no magic**_

![](images/02-why/magic.jpg)


---
^ You do this by teaching not only coding.

^ but also how the internet is functioning

^ how a robot is controlled

^ and you let them tinker around with electronics.

## **_Learn Coding but also:_**
## [fit] Internet, Robotics
## [fit] Tinkering

---
^ Teaching Coding still makes sense

^ It's only one part of understanding technology

^ but you benefit in many ways when you learn to code.

## [fit] **_Learning to Code_**
## still makes sense

---
^ It stretches your mind

^ and it creates a thinking which is useful in all domains.

> "Learning to write programs **_stretches your mind_**.."
-- Bill Gates

---
^ As a coder

^ you make the transition from being a consumer to a producer

^ who can tell stories and create own worlds in the computer

## [fit] **_be a producer_**
## not a consumer

---
^ The room for creativity is endless.

^ Itâ€™s like painting and music but often more accessible and affordable.

# [fit] Coding
## is like
# [fit] _**painting & music**_

---
^ Speaking of affordable. Coding gives you chances.

^ Computer's are cheap nowadays.

^ Even poor kids can afford it.

## [fit] Chances

---
^ Diversity. The computer just don't care who you are.

^ Everybody can become a coder.

## [fit] Diversity

---
^ And coding gives your child another perspective about dreamjobs.

^ Just look at me. I wanted to be a policeman first, then a stock broker because I was good in math

^ and today the coding kid became a programmer just by watching TV.

## [fit] Perspective

---
[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ I hope I have convinced you by now why teaching coding matters

^ So let me show you some possibilities how to teach kids about technology and computer science.

# ~~1. Why it matters~~
# [fit] _2. how to teach_
# 3. where to teach

---
^ I will present you now a list of my favourite tools I love to use when teaching

^ It's about Tinkering, Robots and actual Coding

# _**My favourite toolset**_

# [fit] Tinkering, Robots, Coding

---
[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ Let's have a look at Tinkering.

^ This is all about playing around with electronics.

## [fit] _Tinkering_

---
^ For example with a drawbot.

^ This is a toy that every kid starting with 4 years can build by himself.
## [fit] Drawbot

---
^ The parts cost less than 2 EUR

^ You have three legs made of pens, a battery and a rotating motor.


![fit](images/03-how/drawbot.jpg )

---
^ When activated the robot will vibrate

^ and start walking around drawing on the underlying surface

^ This looks like real art in the end

^ and is so much fun for the kids to watch their robot to be alive.

^ Let's go to the next topic.

![left fill](images/03-how/drawbot-drawing.jpg )
![right fill](images/03-how/drawbot-small.gif)

---
^ A Makey Makey

^ Its simplicity is awesome.

## [fit] Makey Makey

---
^ Itâ€™s basically a board that pretends to be a computer keyboard.

^ You use the alligator clips to connect conductive objects with it

![](images/03-how/makeymakey.jpg )

---
^ When two connected objects touch each other

^ they close a circuit on the MakeyMakey

^ and you virtually press a defined key

^ And what can you do with it?

![](images/03-how/tinkering/circuit.jpg )

---
^ Build a Super Mario Controller

^ Find a mario game that you can control with your keyboard

^ Take some play Dooh - which is suprisingly conductive

^ Build your own game controller to move and jump.

^ And finally switch from the keyboard to your own built device.

![](images/03-how/tinkering/makey-markio.gif )

---
[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ Programable Robots!
## [fit] _Robots_

---
^ They are everythere

^ Many of them can be programmed with child friendly programming language.

^ Let me show you some.

![](images/03-how/robot-generic.gif )

---
^ Say hello to Dash & Dot.

^ Those are robots with many sensors

^ and they can communicate with LEDs and speakers.

^ They cost around 200 EUR

# [fit] Dash
# &
# [fit] Dot
![left](images/03-how/dash-dot-small.gif)

---
^ You can use the app WONDER where everything is about exploring and adventures.

^ You don't create programs but you solve missions by using commands for light, sound or movement.

![fit](images/03-how/wonder-app.jpg)

---
^ There is also an app where you have more of a coding experience.

^ This gives the kid a focus on their own creativity with the robots.

![fit](images/03-how/wonder-blockly-app.jpg)

---
^ mbot- my favorite robot.

## [fit] mbot

---
^ He's based on Arduino uno and OpenSource.

^ This means you could create all parts yourself and use the software for free.

^ You can of course buy it as a package for 80 EUR.

^ What's so special about it ?

![](images/03-how/mbot.jpg)

---
^ That the kid will assemble it.

^ Usuallly within 20mins

^ You can then start an automatic program, use an app or code your own program.

![fill](images/03-how/mbot-build-small.gif)

---
^ When you activate the autonomous driving mode.

^ It will use its ultrasonic and special line sensor

^ to follow a line and avoid obstacles in front if it.

![fill](images/03-how/mbot-line-small.gif)

---
^ Letâ€™s look how coding is being teached.

^ You usually tackle it in three different parts.

^ Analog activity, playing games and dive into the actual coding experience.

## [fit] Coding

---
^ Let's look at the analog activity.

^ If you want to control a robot you have to behave like a robot first.

^ So let's play the human robot game.

## [fit] The Human Robot

---
^ One kid or you dresses up as a robot.

^ A helmet is usually enough for the illusion but a full costume like this is never wrong.

^ You explain the kids in the round that they can only use five commands to control the robot.

^ forward, turn left, turn right, backward and stop

^ Let's begin

![fill](images/03-how/human-robot.jpg)

---
^ Imagine this task:

^ You want the robot to turn to the right and walk in that direction.

^ So you begin with a turn right, right?

^ Let's see what happens after the kids yell that command to the robot.

## $ROBOT: **_<TURN RIGHT>_**

---
^ The robot will spin forever and ever and ever of course.

^ The command was correct but not exact enough.

^ They should have said turn right - a quarter.

^ While spinning around, somebody will hopefully scream a `stooooop` to the desperate robot

![fill](images/03-how/robot-daleks-spin.gif)

---
^ In the end kids really love that game, collaborate and understand the limits of a machine

^ They also understand the requirement of exact commands

^ And to put one command after another - just like in programming.

![fill](images/03-how/haba-robot.jpg)

---
^ Your crowd is ready for some more fun.

^ Letâ€™s play some coding games.

## [fit] Coding
## [fit] Games

---
^ There is a movement called Hour of Code to do so

^ There are dozens of one-hour games and tutorial translated in 45 languages.

^ Everybody is encouraged to try it out.

## [fit] Hour of Code
## **_one-hour tutorials_**

---
^ The games are themed after kidâ€™s darlings like Ice Princess Elsa, Minecraft or Angry Birds.

^ And they teach the principals of programming while playing.

![fill](images/03-how/hoc-overview.png)

---
^ Ok let's play a game

^ I usually pick a labyrinth style game to follow up with the human robot example.

^ This is the Zombie Level where a zombie has to be guided to his favorite food.

^ A sunflower of course!

![fit](images/03-how/code-org/new/zombie-idle.gif)

---
^ Commands are given with colorful blocks and snapped together like in a puzzle.

^ You use a simple set of commands to do so.

^ Like move forward, turn left, turn right


![](images/03-how/code-org/zombie.png)
## [fit] _**Commands**_

![inline](images/03-how/code-org/new/zombie-snap.gif)

---
^ Kids will usually place one command after the other

^ That's simple and it's working

^ But it results in a huge list

^ They canâ€™t even complete the level as they are forced to use a new block.

^ The pink one here.

![](images/03-how/code-org/new/zombie-idiomatic-small.gif)

---
^ I then show them the pattern of 4 blocks.

^ forward, left, forward, right

^ forward, left, forward, right

^ and let them reorganize their code

![](images/03-how/code-org/zombie.png)

![inline](images/03-how/code-org/new/zombie-refactor-small.gif)

---
^ And success! They usually just know what to do.

^ Pick the pink loop block and place the repeating pattern inside.

^ I love this moment.

![fit](images/03-how/code-org/new/zombie-success-small.gif)

---
^ I explain that this is what a computer is for.

^ The computer should repeat the boring stuff, it's not your task.

^ After an hour the kids should have internalized those block based commands...

![](images/03-how/working-roboter.gif)

---
^ and they are ready for Scratch to do some real coding.

^ Scratch is the most famous tool in kids programming.

![](images/03-how/scratch/scratch-logo.jpg)

---

^ It was invented by Mitchel Resnick at the MIT Media Lab in 2002.

^ Scratch can be used as an application or online in the web browser through flash.

^ The next version 3 is based on HTML5 and will be released this August.

![](images/03-how/scratch/scratch-mitchel.jpg)

---
^ Everything you code can be shared on the Scratch website

^ and remixed by others as the `source code` is always accessible.

![fill](images/03-how/scratch/scratch-gallery.png)

---
^ Let's have a look inside.

^ This is the start screen

^ 1. On the left you have a stage where everything will move around.

^ 2. And on the right you see the coding editor.

^ Thatâ€™s where the **code will be written**.

![fit](images/03-how/scratch/app-01-annotated.jpg)

---
^ Did I just say **written**? Nobody expects you to write a thing.

^ Every available command can be dropped in.

^ That is called block based programming.

^ And you can do funky stuff like this. ----> WAIT GIF

![fit](images/03-how/scratch/new/coolcat-small.gif)

^ To complete this section I brought you something special

^ > A screaming carrot <

^ It's programed in Scratch, will make use of MakeyMakey

^ and is the obvious reason for the sensational title of this talk

[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ I have hopefully convinced you why coding matters and how to teach it by now.

^ Whatâ€™s left is the question where **everybody** could try teaching it.

# ~~1. Why it matters~~
# ~~2. How to teach~~
# [fit] _3. Where to teach_

---
^ I want to stress the word everybody.

^ You donâ€™t have to be a programmer

^ Everybody can learn coding and everybody can teach about coding or robots.

# [fit] **_Everybody_**
# can
# [fit] teach

---
^ I started teaching coding to kids in my spare time exactly one and a half year ago at Haba Digitalwerkstatt.

^ They started in Berlin in 2016 and opened their office in Munich in 2017

# [fit] Digitalwerkstatt

---
^ Their program is about coding with Scratch, Robotics, Stop Motion movies and exploring worlds in Minecraft.

^ If you want to try it, just drop them a mail like I did.

![fill](images/04-where/haba-gruppe.jpg)

---
## [fit] Hour of Code
^ You could also host an Hour of Code event

^ Where you play games and explain the basics of programming to interested people

---
^ You might even find some Hour of Code in your hometown.

^ Try to join and get in touch with the organizers.

![fill](images/04-where/hourofcode.png)

---
^ Don't forget your family at home.

^ You can start teaching your own kids and relatives easily with the tools I have shown you.

# [fit] At home

---
^ You won't believe it but designers, project managers or maybe your clients are eager to learn coding too.

^ They will understand you better the next time you talk about bit & bytes

^ What about me, the teacher? What do I get??

# _what about me?_
# [fit] _Your benefits_

---
