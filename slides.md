^ And just to make sure. In this presentation we talk about kids in the age of 6-12 years.

^ I hope you enjoy it.

^ Let's go back to me as the coding kid.

^ I'm not the youngest anymore and nostalgia fun is guaranteed.

# [fit] *Nostalgia Fun*
## *with*
# [fit] *The coding kid*

---
^ So that you have some inner picture. That's me. I'm ten years old.

![left](images/01-intro/me.jpg)
# [fit] That's me

---
^ It's 1994. I call this chapter of my life Magazine Hoarder

^ For a reason.

# [fit] **_1994_**
## [fit] Magazine Hoarder

---
^ At that time I love to play with my Super Nintendo and my Sega Game Gear.

![fill](images/01-intro/my-snes.jpg)
![fill](images/01-intro/gamegear.jpg)

---
^ My favourite place to be, month by month, is the store with the huge shelf of magazines.

![left fill](images/01-intro/shelves-magazine.jpg)
# [fit] Favourite
# [fit] Place

---
^ I buy there a lof of magazines. Like Club Nintendo, PC Games and Total!

^ Those are magazines about consoles.

^ I bet some people here recognize those magazines.

![fill](images/01-intro/magazin/01-pcgames.jpg)
![fill](images/01-intro/magazin/01-total.jpg)

---
^ It's 1995 now

^ and I'm buying even more magazines.

# [fit] **_1995_**
# [fit] Still a Hoarder
---
^ In addition to the gaming magazines

^ I also get those about computers like PC Welt, Chip and Ct.

^ This must have been a really expensive time for my parents.

![fill](images/01-intro/magazin/02-chip.jpg)
![fill](images/01-intro/magazin/02-ct.jpg)

---
^ Most magazines had some CD attached.

^ The ones about computers contained application, demos, drivers & patches.

^ Why? Because internet was not available to everyone and bandwidth was limited.

![left fill](images/01-intro/pcwelt-cd.jpg)

# [fit] Drivers
# &
# [fit] Patches
---
^ Could I use those CDs ? Not at all.

^ as I didn't even owned a computer.

^ But I still grew to a young computer expert for my family.

![fit](images/01-intro/paperboard-computer.jpg)

---
^ I only got in touch with real computers when visiting my friends to play games

^ Or when my older sister took me in her agency office.

^ There I had the opportunity to tinker around on a Mac running the wonderful OS 9.

^ Photoshop was my favourite application.

![fill](images/01-intro/mac-os9.png)

---
^ I created dozens of those galaxy spirals.

^ By using a combination of cloud effect, swirl, lightning effect and lens flare.

^ Whatever the kid would find in the effects section

![fill](images/01-intro/universe.jpg)

---
^ Let's jump to 1997, the year of my first PC.

# [fit] **_1997_**
# [fit] My first PC
---
^ Actually I had to wait until Christmas 1997.

^ It's now three years since I bought my first computer magazine.

![fit](images/01-intro/xmas-monitor-tree.jpg)

---
^ That computer was running Windows 95 on a Pentium MMX 200 Mhz with a 4GB hard disk.

^ This thing had of course no internet.

^ And what does a kid do with a computer ?

![fill](images/01-intro/computer-windows95.jpg)

---
^ Of course. Playing games.

^ It's 1998 and I enjoy my new computer day and night.

# [fit] **_1998_**
# [fit] PC Gaming
---
^ My very first game I bought was Blade Runner from Westwood Studios.

^ It was distributed on 4 CDs and consumed half of my disk space.

![fit](images/01-intro/blade-runner.jpg)

---
^ Let's hurry to 1999. The year I got my internet access.

# [fit] **_1999_**
# [fit] Internet

---
^ I used a 56k modem to do so.

^ This was by the way slower than your throttled dataplan on your smartphone.

^ Let's listen to the iconic sound for a quick flashback.

^ After Video: I still can’t believe the internet worked back then.

![right fit](images/01-intro/modem.jpg)

---
^ I'm also watching that new tv station called  **NBC Giga**

^ Young moderators are talking about internet stuff, games and computer news.

^ Sure as hell I loved that tv station.

^ It must be somewhen around April 1999.

^ I'm at home from school before leaving for afternoon classes

^ This particular day two guys were showing a new application

![fill](images/01-intro/giga/giga-george-jochen.jpg)


---
^ There was a timeline where they could easily animate a red ball bouncing around.

^ Must have looked like this.

![fill](images/01-intro/giga/red-ball.gif)

---
^ I was impressed

^ They mentioned the name of the application.

^ But I had to hurry back to school and didn't write it down.

^ After school I wanted to search for a demo version on my magazine cds.

# [fit] I was impressed

---
^ But I forgot the name.

^ The week went by quickly.

# [fit] **_I forgot the name_**

---
^ It is Saturday

^ This means getting up as early as possible

^ and watching series like Captain Future, Duck Tales or the gummybears.

^ Around lunch time..

![](images/01-intro/captainfuture.jpg)

---
^ .. I watched Giga TV again.

^ And I could not believe it.

^ It was the repeated show from earlier of the week.

![fill](images/01-intro/giga/giga-logo.gif)

---
^ I was frozen in front of my TV

^ I holded my breath

^ I waited for the moment they would tell me that name I forgot.

^ and then

![fill](images/01-intro/homer-excited.gif )

---
^ There it was.

![fill](images/01-intro/homer-happy-2.gif )

---
^ It was Macromedia Flash 4. Released just weeks before.

![fit](images/01-intro/flash4-splash.png )

---
[.header: text-scale(0.5)]
^ This moment just now?

^ This was genesis of my programming career.

# [fit] Genesis
## of my
# [fit] **_programming career_**

---
^ Flash looked like this.

^ A timeline, some layers, a stage and some tools.

![fit](images/01-intro/flash4-stage.jpg )

---
^ I quickly found the Actions panel.

^ It was the place to code.

![fit](images/01-intro/flash4-actions.gif )

---
^ Soon I was able to program the very famous Yugop Menu

^ This menu was named by Yugo Nakamura. He was a star of the flash scene.

^ It's an horizontal navigation with the illusion of infinity.

^ I was so good in programming this thing...

![inline](images/01-intro/yugop-nakamura.jpg )
![inline fill](images/01-intro/yugop-menu.gif )

---
^ ...that I could sell it to agencies.

^ To earn my first money with 15 years.

![fill](images/01-intro/first-money.png )

---
^ It was an amazing time full of amazing websites

^ What you see here is THE PORTAL from derbauer.

^ Yes this was a website.

^ I was soooo impressed back then I and wanted to do the same.

![fill](images/01-intro/derbauer-theportal-long.gif )

---
^ By the way and just to remind you.

^ The web without flash?

^ It looked like that.

![inline fill](images/01-intro/old-randompage.png) ![inline fill](images/01-intro/old-google.jpg)

---
^ So what's my point you're asking?

# [fit] So what's my **_point_** ?

---
^ Remember the genesis of my programming career in front of the TV ?

^ I wish I would have had some guidance during school

^ So that more than a single moment would have guided me to my career.

![](images/01-intro/infront-of-tv.jpg)

---
^ Instead

^ The most digital thing I had in primary school was this

![fit](images/01-intro/calculator.jpg)

---
^ Later the computer classes I remember were more like this.

![](images/01-intro/sleepy-class.jpg)

---
^ Computer classes today are still bad.

^ The hardware, if any, outdated

^ Most teachers are not educated

^ The curriculum is boring

![](images/01-intro/class-today.jpg)

---
^ I want to make a difference and change things
# [fit] Make a
# [fit] difference
---
^ That's why I'm teaching kids coding in my spare time

^ And I want you to know why I am doing this

^ and that you can do it too.

![](images/01-intro/me-teaching.jpg)

---
[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ So for the next 30 minutes I will talk about

^  1. Why coding matters.

^  2. How to teach it.

^  3. and where to teach it.

# [fit] _1. Why it matters_
# [fit] _2. How to teach_
# [fit] _3. Where to teach_

[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ So why does coding for kids matter at all?

^ Let's start with something easy.

# [fit] _1. Why it matters_
# 2. How to teach
# 3. Where to teach

---
^ We all can describe to a child how a combustion engine works more or less.

^ Right?

![](images/02-why/combustion-engine.jpg )
# _**combustion engine**_

---
^ We can tell how the human body works.

![](images/02-why/human-body.jpg )
# _**human body**_

---
^ But when you a press the play button a youtube video.

![](images/02-why/youtube-play.jpg )
# _**youtube play button**_
---
^ Yeah. What would you tell that kid :)

^ It's hard for many of us.

^ It's like something was missing in school.

^ So let's fix this for our children by...

# what would **_YOU_** tell that kid?

---
^ ...teaching - coding - to - kids-

^ The whole world is crazy about it.

^ Just listen carefully to media, hear parents talking, teachers demanding and politicians promising.

^ And even me, standing here, talking to you, is selling it as the solution for the play button thing.

> _"teaching **coding** to kids"_
-- mentioned by media, parents, teachers, politicians, well even me standing here

---
^ New York's former major Bloomberg even had a new year resolution promising to take coding courses.

![fit](images/02-why/new-year-resolution.jpg )

---
^ Angela Merkel is talking about coding as the new literacy for young people besides reading, writing and math.

> _**"coding is the new literacy for young people"**_
-- Bundeskanzlerin Merkel, Digitalkonferenz, 2016 (liberally translated)

![fit](images/02-why/merkel.jpg )

---
^ It even reaches levels like this.

^ Congressman Tony Cárdenas from Southern California introduced a bill called with exactly that name in 2013.

# [fit] 416D65726963612043616E20436F646520
# **_Act of 2013_**

---
^ It’s a string of 34 letters in ASCII hexadecimal code and translates to ”America Can Code."
# [fit] 416D65726963612043616E20436F646520
# [fit] _**America Can Code**_

![fit](images/02-why/ascii-table-hints.png )

---
^ All that shows that something is going on.

^ That the world is concerned about the future of our kids.

# [fit] Concerned

---
^ or that we fear that technology leaves us behind

^ and that our kids should fix it.

^ No matter what, the demand is the same...

# [fit] Fear of
# [fit] Technology

---
^ ...Our kids should learn coding.

^ Is this justified? Should our kids learn coding?

^ I’m biased in this question for obvious reasons.

^ So let me step back and let's look at the bigger picture.

# [fit] Kids
# **_should learn_**
# [fit] coding

---
^ We start by looking at a mechanic

^ and apply the whole coding discussion onto it.

^ It goes like this:

# [fit] _**The mechanic**_
![](images/02-why/mechanic.jpg )

---
^ It's sort of like an **obsession** with being an **auto mechanic**

<!-- This is mechanic comparison is coming from npr.org -->
# [fit] _**Obession**_

---
^ There are **tons of cars**, there's tons of **driving** ...

# [fit] **_Tons of cars_**

---
^ but I think it's a little **silly** to go around saying
#### little
## **_silly_**

---
^ that **everyone**  should **_really_** learn to be an auto mechanic
# [fit] _**Everyone**_

---
^ just because cars are so **_essential_** to the **functioning** of our society.

# [fit] **_Essential_**

---
^ Hell yeah! That would be silly indeed.

^ But what do we do?

# [fit] **_Oh Yeah!_**
# [fit] that would be silly indeed

---
^ There is tons of technology

^ and we go around and tell everybody how important coding is.

![](images/02-why/medieval-priest.jpg)

---
^ So are we silly then?

# [fit] ArE wE **_silly_**?!

---
^ Or..

^ Are we are just talking about something else than coding?

# OR..

---
^ What if the **word coding**, that is used so inflationary **is just blatantly wrong** ?
# [fit] ~~coding~~

---
^ The question is: What do people actually mean with coding.

# What do people actually mean with **_coding_** ?

---
^ Let me go back some years.

^ Do you know when the first programming language was invented?

# [fit] First
# [fit] Programming Language

---
^ In 1943 by Konrad Zuse

^ He just invented his famous Z3

^ And together with it the very first programming language.

# [fit] _**1943.** Konrad Zuse._
![](images/02-why/konrad-zuse.jpg )

---
^ The Z3 looked like that.

^ Technology escalated then pretty quickly

![](images/02-why/konrad-z3.jpg )

---
^ With your smartphone you hold a device that combines everything we learned in the past 70 years.

^ That’s a lot and very complex

^ It makes computer science very difficult and not easy to talk about.

![](images/02-why/smartphones.jpg )
# [fit] _70 years later_
# **_Technology is complex_**

---
^ Coding on the other side is easy to grasp.

^ You frequently see it in movies and it's therefore easy explained.

# [fit] Coding?
## **_Sure, I know that from movies_**

---
^ Take someone

^ Add a keyboard

^ And watch that person giving commands to a computer.

^ That’s coding and the people understand it.

![](images/02-why/homer-programmer-2.gif )

---
^ So if coding is such an easy word

^ Let’s try a thesis.

# Let's try a
# [fit] _**Thesis**_

---
[.header: text-scale(0.5)]
^ When people talk about coding they actually mean technology.
## When people talk about
# [fit] **_coding_**
## they actually mean
# [fit] **_technology_**

---
<!-- -- via kidscodecs.com -->

^ It's now about exposure to technology, computer and programming

^ Most of the kids will never be a coder anyway.

> **_Exposure to technology_**, computer science and programming.

---
^ Our children should learn that smartphones and technology are not magical.

^ That there are limitations, benefits and possibilities from using them.

## [fit] _no magic_

![](images/02-why/magic.jpg)

---
^ And everything suddenly makes sense.

# [fit]Everything
# **_suddenly makes sense_**

---
^ It was never about coding only.

^ When the people say "our kids need to learn coding"

^ they actually say "our kids need to learn technology"

^ so they can understand the bigger picture, the connecting lines.

# our kids need to learn
# [fit]  ~~coding~~ **_technology_**
---
^ You do this by teaching not only coding.

^ but also how the internet is functioning

^ how a roboter is build and controlled

^ How algorithms are working

^ and let them tinker around with electronics.

^ It stretches your mind

^ and it creates a thinking which is useful in all domains.

> "Learning to write programs **_stretches your mind_**.."
-- Bill Gates

---
^ Coding boosts your creativity.

^ You can create worlds in the computer, you can try out ideas, you can tell stories.

^ The room for creativity is endless.

^ It’s like painting and music but often more accessible and affordable.

# [fit] Coding
## is like
# [fit] _**painting & music**_

---
^ Speaking of affordable. Coding gives you chances.

^ Computer's are cheap nowadays.

^ Even poor kids in every country can try it.

## [fit] Chances

---
^ Diversity. The computer just don't care who you are. Everybody can be a coder.

## [fit] Diversity

---
^ And coding gives your child another perspective about dreamjobs.

^ Just look at me. I wanted to be a policeman first, than a stockbroker to get rich

^ and now the coding kid became a programmer by watching TV.

[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ I hope I have convinced you by now why teaching coding matters

^ So let me show you some possibilities how to teach kids about technology and computer science.

# ~~1. Why it matters~~
# [fit] _2. how to teach_
# 3. where to teach

---
^ I will present you now a list of my favourite tools I love to use when teaching

^ Tinkering, Robots and actual Coding

# _**My favourite toolset**_

# [fit] Tinkering, Robots, Coding

---
[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ Let's have a look at Tinkering.

^ This is all about playing around with electronics.

## [fit] _Tinkering_

---
^ A drawbot.

^ This is an toy which every kid starting with 4 years can build.
## [fit] Drawbot

---
^ The parts cost less than 2 EUR

^ You have three legs made of pens, a battery and a motor with an unbalanced weight rotating.

^ Don't forget to decorate the bot so it looks like an animal and the like.

^ And then magic happens.


![fit](images/03-how/drawbot.jpg )

---
^ When activated the robot will vibrate

^ and start walking around drawing on the underlying surface

^ This looks like real art in the end

^ and is so much fun for the kids to watch their robot to be alive.

^ Let's go to the next topic.

![left fill](images/03-how/drawbot-drawing.jpg )
![right fill](images/03-how/drawbot.gif)

---
^ A Makey Makey

^ Its simplicity is awesome.

## [fit] Makey Makey

---
^ It’s basically a board that pretends to be a keyboard.

^ You use the alligator clips to connect conductive objects with it

![](images/03-how/makeymakey.jpg )

---
^ When closing a circuit you virtually press a key

^ And what can you do with it?

![](images/03-how/tinkering/circuit.jpg )

---
^ Well, make a banana piano.

^ Find some piano game where you can play with your keyboard keys.

^ Each banana will represent a single key on the keyboard

^ Connect them with Makey Makey

^ And play your bananas

![](images/03-how/tinkering/haba-banana.jpg )

---
^ A Super Mario Controller

^ Same here. Find a mario game with keyboard controls

^ Build your own controller with play dooh - which is suprisingly conductive.

^ Switch from the keyboard to your own device.

![](images/03-how/tinkering/makey-markio.gif )

---
^ And another one. Let me introduce you to the Screaming carrot.

![fit](images/03-how/tinkering/screaming-carrot.jpg)

---
[.background-color: #fdc552]
^ Programable Robots!
## [fit] _Robots_

---
^ There are a lot of them out there.

^ Many of them can be programmed with child friendly programming language.

^ Let me show you some.

![](images/03-how/robot-generic.gif )

---
^ That's Ollie and Sphero.

^ Two different toys from the same brand

^ Connects through Bluetooth with your smartphone.

^ You can drive around with an app or program them.

^ Costs around 80 EUR

# [fit] OLLIE
# &
# [fit] Sphero
![left](images/03-how/sphero-and-ollie.png)

---
^ Say hello to Dash & Dot.

^ Those are more complex and expensive robots. Costs around 200 EUR

^ They have many sensors and can communicate with LEDs and speakers.

^ You use the apps Wonder or Blockly to program them.

# [fit] Dash
# &
# [fit] Dot
![left](images/03-how/dash-dot.gif)

---
^ The wonder app is about exploring and adventures.

^ You don't create programs but you solve missions.

^ You solve those missions by linking behaviors about lights, sound or move.

![fit](images/03-how/wonder-app.jpg)

---
^ On the other hand there is Blockly.

^ Blockly offers more of a coding experience by using blocks with text to make programs.

^ This gives the kid a focus on their own creativity.

![fit](images/03-how/wonder-blockly-app.jpg)

---
^ Not hard to see that here comes my favorite.

^ It's mbot and I call him the master of all robots.

## [fit] mbot
## **_the master of all robots_**

---
^ He's made by Makeblock.

^ and based on Arduino uno

^ It's OpenSource which means all parts and all software can be used without paying money.

^ You can of course buy it as a package for 80 EUR.

![](images/03-how/mbot.jpg)

---
^ What's so special about it ? That the kid will assemble it.

^ Usuallly within 20mins

^ You can then start an automatic program, use an app or code your own program.

![fill](images/03-how/mbot-build.gif)

---
^ When you activate the autonomous driving mode.

^ It will use its ultrasonic and special line sensor

^ to follow a line and avoid obstacles in front if it.

![fill](images/03-how/mbot-line.gif)

---
^ You can also program it yourself.

^ You use makeblocks own software called mBlock to write and upload the code.

![fill](images/03-how/mbot-mblock.png)

---
^ Speaking of coding, let’s look how this is being teached.

^ You usually tackle it in three different parts.

^ Analog activity, playing games and dive into the actual coding experience.

## [fit] Coding

---
^ Let's look at the analog activity.

^ If you want to control a robot you have behave like a robot first.

^ So let's play the human robot game.

## [fit] The Human Robot

---
^ One kid or you dresses up as a robot.

^ A helmet is usually enough for the illusion but a full costume like this is never wrong.

^ You explain the kids in the round that they can only use five commands to control the robot.

^ forward, left, right, backward and stop

^ Let's begin

![fill](images/03-how/human-robot.jpg)

---
^ Imagine this task:

^ You want the robot to turn to the right and walk in that direction.

^ So you begin with a turn right, right?

^ Let's see what happens after the kids yell that command to the robot.

## $ROBOT: **_<TURN RIGHT>_**

---
^ The robot will spin forever and ever and ever of course.

^ The command was correct but not exact enough.

^ They should have said turn right - a quarter.

^ While spinning around, somebody will hopefully scream a `stooooop`.

![fill](images/03-how/robot-daleks-spin.gif)

---
^ In the end kids really love that game, collaborate and understand the limits of a machine

^ They also understand the requirement of exact commands

^ and to put one command after another - just like in programming.

![fill](images/03-how/haba-robot.jpg)

---
^ Your crowd is ready for some more fun.

^ Let’s play some coding games on code.org.

^ Those games are themed after kid’s darlings like Ice Princess Elsa, Minecraft or Angry Birds.

^ And they teach them principals of programming while playing.

^ But wait.

## [fit] Coding
## [fit] Games

---
^ Some infos about Code.org.

^ Founded in 2013, code.org is a non-profit organization and was launched by Hadi and Ali Partovi

^ It is now supported by the largest companies around the world including amazon, facebook, microsoft & google.

![left](images/03-how/code-org/logo.png)
## [fit] code.org
## **non-profit by Hadi and Ali Partovi**

---
^ They also created the movement Hour of Code

^ There are dozens of one-hour tutorials and games translated in 45 languages.

^ Everybody is encouraged to try it out.

## [fit] Hour of Code
## **_one-hour tutorials_**

---
^ Even a US president.

^ That's a photo from The White House where they hold an Hour Of Code event in 2014.

^ Hour of Code takes place every year from 4.-10. December.

![](images/03-how/code-org/potus.jpg)

---
^ Ok let's play a game

^ In every game there are multiple levels with increasing difficulty.

^ You slowly introduce conditionals (if-else), loops and new commands.

^ I usually pick a labyrinth style game to follow up with the human robot example.

^ This is the Zombie Level which is an intermediate level.

^ The zombie has to be guided to his favorite food.

^ A sunflower of course!

![fit](images/03-how/code-org/new/zombie-idle.gif)

---
^ Commands are given with colorful blocks and snapped together like in a puzzle.

^ You use a simple set of commands to do so.

^ Like move forward, turn left, turn right


![](images/03-how/code-org/zombie.png)
## [fit] _**Commands**_

![inline](images/03-how/code-org/new/zombie-snap.gif)

---
^ Kids will usually place one command after the other

^ That's their idiomatic version and it's working

^ But it results in a huge list

^ They can’t even complete the level as they are forced to use a new block. The
 pink one here.

![](images/03-how/code-org/new/zombie-idiomatic.gif)

---
^ I then show them the pattern of 4 blocks.

^ forward, left, forward, right

^ and let them refactor their code to something very beautiful.

![](images/03-how/code-org/zombie.png)

![inline](images/03-how/code-org/new/zombie-refactor.gif)

---
^ And success! They usually just know what to do.

^ Pick the loop block and place the repeating pattern inside.

^ I love this moment. I explain that this is what a computer is for.

![fit](images/03-how/code-org/new/zombie-success.gif)

^ The computer should repeat the boring stuff, it's not your task.

^ After an hour the kids should have internalized those block based commands...

^ and they are ready for Scratch to do some real coding.

^ Scratch can be used as an application and online in the web browser through flash.

^ Scratch 3.0 is in active development, based on HTML5 and will be released this August.

^ Scratch is the holy grail of kids programming.

^ It’s a programming language invented by Mitchel Resnick at the MIT Media Lab.

^ Everything you code can be shared on the Scratch website

^ and remixed by others as the `source code` is always accessible.

^ Let's have a look inside.

^ This is the start screen

^ 1. On the left you have a stage where everything will move around.

^ 2. And on the right you see the coding editor.

^ That’s where the **code will be written**.

![fit](images/03-how/scratch/app-01-annotated.jpg)

---
^ Did I just say **written**? Nobody expects you to write a thing.

^ Every available command can be dropped in.

^ That is called block based programming.

^ I have hopefully convinced you why coding matters and how to teach it by now.

^ What’s left is the question where **everybody** could try teaching it.

# ~~1. Why it matters~~
# ~~2. How to teach~~
# [fit] _3. Where to teach_

^ I want to stress the word everybody.

^ You don’t have to be a programmer

^ Everybody can learn coding and everybody can teach about coding or robots.

^ I started teaching coding to kids in my spare time exactly a year ago at Haba Digitalwerkstatt.

^ Haba is a famous toy manufacturer in Germany. Digitalwerkstatt is a 100% subsidiary of them.

^ Digitalwerkstatt translates to digital garage.

^ They opened in the beginning of 2017 in Munich after being very successful in Berlin during 2016.

^ There are regular courses and one-off workshops for children from 5 to 14 years about coding, robotics, stop motion movies, even exploring worlds in Minecraft.

^ If you want to try it, just drop them a mail like I did.

## [fit] Hour of Code
^ You could also host an Hour of Code yourself

^ Play games and explain the basics of programming to interested people

---
^ Hour of code can be hosted all year.

^ You might even find some Hour of Code in your hometown. Try to join and get in touch with the organizers.

^ Don't forget your family at home.

^ You can start teaching your own kids and relatives easily with the tools I have shown you.

# [fit] At home

^ Well. When did you play with toys for no reason the last time?

^ It' healthy, it relaxes your mind.

^ and it entertains the kid inside you.

^ By teaching about coding

^ You are excused to play with toys

^ You are excused to program stupid jokes

^ And you can finally try out Minecraft

# Entertain
# [fit] the kid

^ To think about what to do with a MakeyMakey

^ to create challenging tasks in Minecraft for kids

^ and to use Scratch for yourself to surprise your Mama on Mother's day.

^ Teaching coding makes you more creative.

^ Mentoring is hard. You have to explain things that are obvious to you.

^ Did you ever try to explain if & else to your mother?

^ I explain it slowly and repetetive to kids. It's so hard.

^ Expect nothing and start from scratch.

^ You have to reflect on the very, very basics of programming

^ This will help you throughout your whole mentoring career!
