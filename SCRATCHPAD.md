## Live Coding Notes
That's

1. Here you can see a carrot, a kitchen knife and the MakeyMakey board.

2. The MakeyMakey has different contact points labelled with the corresponding key on the keyboard. That's the SPACE key contact.

3. I will now connect the SPACE key to the carrot with this cable

4. To close the circuit I want to use a knife which I will also connect to the MakeyMakey- this time to GROUND.

5. Now let's connect the MakeyMakey to the computer with USB. All those lights tell us that it has turned on

6. When I touch the carrot with the knife you see a green LED glowing on the MakeyMakey and also a visual appearing that I programed.

7. This means everything is working. So let's make it scream.

8. In Scratch I can detect when a key is being pressed. It's set to SPACE.

9. I want to play a sound instead of showing the visual. So switch that.

10. Now when I touch the carrot with the knife, MakeyMakey will tell the computer the SPACE key is pressed and Scratch will play a horrible screaming sound.

11. Let's have some fun with the carrot now.

### Show Carrot
1. Prepare everything in a box then reveeal?
2. or quickly put everything together on stage ?

My coding environment is called Scratch
and I will show you more of it later in the talk.

Now let's focus on the screaming carrot.
Here I have a breadboard, a carrot, a kitchen knife and the MakeyMakey device.

1. The MakeyMakey has different contact points labelled with the simulated key it will press
2. Here is the contact for the SPACE key.
3. I will now connect the carrot to the SPACE key
4. I want to close the circuit when I touch the carrot with the knife
5. To do so I will connect to knife with the GROUND bar on the MakeyMakey
6. Let's connect the MakeyMakey through USB. The blinking shows it's ready now
7. If I touch the carrot with the knife you see a LED glowing at the SPACE contact
8. I also prepared a visual that shows itself then
8. This means everything is working. And what do we do with it?
9. Let us cut the carrot and make it scream
10. The ony thing to do is to play a horrible scream instead of showing the visual
11. Let's assign a fitting sound
12. And now start cutting the carrot.

## My Talk Proposal
This was my accepted talk proposal.

### Title
About Coding Kids and Screaming Carrots

### Description
Kids will rule the world with coding as their superpower.
My talk will show how you can playfully teach coding to kids with robots, games and colorful programming tools. I will talk about the hot debate that every kid should learn programming and why it matters for their future. By the end of the day, you will have seen human robots, happy kids and screaming carrots.

### Shorten Description
Kids will rule the world with coding as their superpower. You will learn why coding matters for kids and how robots and screaming carrots can help learning it.

### Motivation
I have a passion which I'd love to talk about. It’s teaching coding to kids. I started programming as a kid and I teach coding to kids in my spare time. It’s just magical to see their glowing eyes when they achieve their goals in Scratch, play around with a MakeyMakey board or create their first stop-motion movie.

The screaming carrot from the title is an entertaining installation where you cut a carrot which then screams. This is always fun and I plan to show something like this in my talk.

### Bio
Learned coding with flash as a kid.
Programed with Flash as a Freelancer for 15 years.
Today I'm a Frontend developer for Angular & React
In my spare time I teach coding to kids, love to tinker around with webgl and love to fold complex Origami.


### Notes
Top:
- Alter der Kinder erwähnt
- Slides
- schön langsam gesprochen und deutlich
- einfache sprache verwendet, sehr gut.
- jokes
- Banana Piano
- Recap!!!



Verbesserung
OK - Madness & Crazy raus - trigger
OK - Intro - about you fehlt
OK - Kids pictures unerkennbar machen
- Angela Merkel, who?
OK - Gelbeschrift manchmal ohne schatten (Slides vereinheitlichen)
OK- slide wo du sagst “add some guy” nehm person
OK- Film bei coding blocks statt images
- Holygrale anderes wort nutzen, ist sehr abgenutzt derzeit
- Thanks slide mehr ausfüllen (mit Kontakt möglichkeiten und dazu sagen wenn jemand interesse hat einfach auf dich zu kommen etc.)


ich erklär dann kurz das sinnerschrader eine agentur in deutschland ist mit mehreren standorten (auch einer in prag) das ich viele meetups mache
