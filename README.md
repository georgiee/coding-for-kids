## My Talk Proposal
This was my accepted talk proposal.

### Title
About Coding Kids and Screaming Carrots

### Description
Kids will rule the world with coding as their superpower.
My talk will show how you can playfully teach coding to kids with robots, games and colorful programming tools. I will talk about the hot debate that every kid should learn programming and why it matters for their future. By the end of the day, you will have seen human robots, happy kids and screaming carrots.

### Shorten Description
Kids will rule the world with coding as their superpower. You will learn why coding matters for kids and how robots and screaming carrots can help learning it.

### Motivation
I have a passion which I'd love to talk about. It’s teaching coding to kids. I started programming as a kid and I teach coding to kids in my spare time. It’s just magical to see their glowing eyes when they achieve their goals in Scratch, play around with a MakeyMakey board or create their first stop-motion movie.

The screaming carrot from the title is an entertaining installation where you cut a carrot which then screams. This is always fun and I plan to show something like this in my talk.
